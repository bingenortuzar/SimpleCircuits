### WARNING: THIS IS LESS THAN AN ALFA VERSION.  

This is the content for [simplecircuits.bingenortuzar.com](http://simplecircuits.bingenortuzar.com)

The idea is making small projects to learn and have fun with my children. Premises are simple:
     
      -Low cost.
      -No soldering.
      -No programming.

Future projects involving soldering and microcontrollers are expected, but not at this moment :P
first projects to add:
        
      -Basic materials
      -First circuits. Glowies â€” Throwies
      -First paper circuit
      -Adding a second led (parallel/serial)
      -Switches
      -Buzzer
      -...
      -Simple wearables

### disclaimer
My English is not good, neither my electrical knowledge, so typos are expected everywhere
