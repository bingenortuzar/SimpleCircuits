The idea is make small projects to learn and have fun with my children. Premises are simple:
      -low cost.
      -No soldering.
      -No programming.

Future projects involving soldering and microcontrollers are expected, but not at this moment :P
first projects to add:
        
      -Basic materials
      -First circuits. Glowies â€” Throwies
      -First paper circuit
      -Adding a second led (parallel/serial)
      -...
      -Simple wearables
