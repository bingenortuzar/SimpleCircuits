This is the base circuit we are going to use in other experiments.

### What we need:
      
        - CR2032 coin battery (or any other 3v coin battery)
        - one led 
        - Copper tape
        - Paper
        - Paper clip

### The circuit schema

We have to draw a path to connect both sides of the battery with the led
